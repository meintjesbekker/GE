The following data will be checked:
1. Geometrical setup of the model
   Layer thickness
   Top and bottom elevation of the layers
   Starting head at constant head cells
2. Time-independent data (if used)
   Horizontal hydraulic conductivity or Transmissivity: zero or negative values 
   Vertical hydraulic conductivity or Leakance: zero or negative values 
   Storage coefficient, specific storage or specific yield: negative values 
   Effective porosity: zero or negative values 
3. Time-dependent data (if used)
   River package: 
      >Conflicts with constant head cells and inactive cells
      >Elevation of the river bed versus the elevation of the cell bottom
      >Elevation of the river bed versus river stage
   Drain package
      >Conflicts with constant head cells and inactive cells
      >Elevation of the drain versus the elevation of the cell bottom
   General-head boundary package
      >Conflicts with constant head cells and inactive cells
   Streamflow Routing package
      >Conflicts with constant head cells and inactive cells
   Well package
      >Conflicts with constant head cells and inactive cells
